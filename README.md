# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to provide a summary of the results of a congressional election in a specific district. This summary will provide the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes recieved by each candidate, the percentage of the total vote vote each candiate recieved, the number of votes cast in each county, which candidate won the election, and which county cast the most votes. This information can be gathered by analyzing the data in Excel, but by writing a Python script we can provide an easy way to anaylze results from other elections. The goal of this project is to deliver a functioning script that can anaylze this specific election's results, and also be re-purposed to analyze the results of other elections.
